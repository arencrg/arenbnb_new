### An Airbnb clone

Here's take two.

## Updates

- 01 Aug 2017 -- My first commit. I've finished setting up Devise and OmniAuth for Facebook, Carrierwave multiple uploads (although I'm having issues with this big chunk of text showing up after the photos....)

- 02 Aug 2017 -- I had to redo a few things cause I realized I had been missing some important parts, but it's all good cause I was able to fix the user profiles (however I still haven't been able to allow non-Facebook user to upload their own avatars... maybe a separate uploader? We'll see). I think I've made pretty decent progress on this one.

- 03 Aug 2017 -- I now have the review system up and running! I wasn't able to do much today either, but I think I'm making pretty good time considering I only wrote code for like, an hour today hahahahaha
